1. ### Minimize the use of Global Variables and Functions
    Global variables and functions can conflict with other code libraries, can be overwritten and cause issues. Functions can be placed in a module or namespace. For variables, local variables or closures can be used instead.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


2. ### Always Declare Local Variables
    Undeclared variables become global variables. Use let or const to declare local variables.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


3. ### Declarations should be at the top
    This keeps all declarations in one place and avoids errors with re-declarations and unintended global variables.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


4. ### Initialize variables when declared
    This simplifies initialization and avoids undefined values.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


5. ### Declare Objects and Arrays with const
    This prevents accidental changes.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


6. ### Don't Use 'new' for Objects
    - Use "" instead of new String()
    - Use 0 instead of new Number()
    - Use false instead of new Boolean()
    - Use {} instead of new Object()
    - Use [] instead of new Array()
    - Use /()/ instead of new RegExp()
    - Use function(){} instead of new Function()

    Primitive values, such as numbers, strings, and booleans, should be treated as primitive data types and not as objects to optimize the execution speed and avoid side-effects.

    Suppose we have a constructor function named Person that initializes a person object with a name and age property.

        function Person(name, age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
        }

        let person1 = new Person("John", 30);
        let person2 = new Person("Alex", 25);

    Now, let's see what happens if we forget to use the 'new' keyword while creating an object from the Person constructor:

        let person3 = Person("Mary", 20);

    In this case, person3 will be undefined because the constructor function doesn't return any value. This can lead to confusion and unexpected results in your code if you're not careful.
    To prevent this kind of issue, it's recommended to use object literals instead of constructors for creating new objects in JavaScript.

7. ### Beware of Automatic Type Conversions
    Use === for comparison to avoid automatic type conversions.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


8. ### Use Parameter Defaults
    Use default values for arguments to avoid undefined values which may break code.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


9. ### End Your Switches with Defaults
    Always add a default case to switch statements, even if you think it's not necessary.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

10. ### Use Static Types with TypeScript or Flow 
    In JavaScript, we have two popular static typing options, TypeScript and Flow. Both of these help us catch errors early on and greatly improve code quality.
    When working with large codebases and complex functions, static typing can greatly increase the maintainability and quality of code. By using TypeScript (or Flow), not only can you catch errors early, but you can also greatly improve code completion and documentation, making it easier for yourself and other developers to understand the code and maintain it over time.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


11. ### Avoid Using eval()
    Avoid using the eval() function, as it poses security risks by allowing arbitrary code to be executed.

    A string variable `code` which contains some JavaScript code needs to be executed dynamically at runtime. The `eval()` function could be used to execute the code:

        let code = "console.log('Hello, world!')";
        eval(code); // Outputs "Hello, world!" to the console

    However, using `eval()` in this way is not recommended since it could open up your application to security vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the `code` variable, which would then be executed by the `eval()` function. For example:

        let code = "alert('You have been hacked!')";
        eval(code); // Displays a popup with the message "You have been hacked!"

    Instead, a safer way to execute dynamic code is using the `Function()` constructor. The `Function()` constructor creates a new Function object that can execute the code passed to it as a string. Here is an example:

        let code = "console.log('Hello, world!')";
        let executeCode = new Function(code);
        executeCode(); // Outputs "Hello, world!" to the console

    With this approach, the code is still executed dynamically at runtime, but there is no risk of code injection since the code is not executed until it is passed to the `Function()` constructor, which provides a controlled environment for the execution of the code.

    While `eval()` can be a powerful tool, it is important to use it with caution and take steps to prevent security vulnerabilities. Using the `Function()` constructor is often a safer and more secure alternative to `eval()`.

12. ### Call things by their name
    Use clear and easily understandable variable and function names, and avoid ambiguous or confusing names.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


13. ### Stick to a strict coding style
    This will help reduce the potential bugs, improve code security, and make it easier for other developers to understand the code. Avoid relying on hacks that may later become outdated as new browser versions are released. Use 'use strict' to enforce stricter syntax and avoid potential errors.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


14. ### Comment as much as needed but not more
    Use commenting to provide relevant information to other developers, but only when necessary. Avoid single line comments, and instead use the /* */ notation for comments.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


15. ### Avoid mixing CSS or styling with other technologies
    Avoid mixing unrelated technologies, such as adding styling with JavaScript. Keep styling information inside CSS to make it easier to manage and modify the styles.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


16. ### Use shortcut notation when it makes sense
    Use shortcuts like object literals, ternary notations, and || notation, whenever possible, to optimize code. In many cases, short-circuiting is a more concise and readable way to express conditions than ternary operators. This approach involves using boolean operators like && and || to check conditions and return values.
    
     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


17. ### Modularize - one function per task
    Break down tasks into smaller functions, and create helper functions for repetitive tasks, which makes the code smaller, manageable, and easy to debug. Function composition helps to organize code into small and modular functions. Avoid creating long chains of functions that can make code difficult to understand and debug. Instead of chaining all of the functions together in one long chain, it's better to break them up into separate functions and calling them individually.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


18. ### Enhance progressively
    Write code that works even when certain technologies are unavailable, like scripting(for non-JS browsers). This enhances the functionality of your webpage or web product.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


19. ### Allow for configuration and translation
    Use a configuration object to contain parameters that are likely to change so that it is easier to maintain the code in the future. 
    
    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


20. ### Avoid heavy nesting
    Avoid excessive nesting in your code, use generic functions instead, and aim for code that is easy to read and understand.

    A common issue with nesting is variable names and loops. Starting with 'i' as the iterator and moving on to 'j', 'k', 'l', and beyond can quickly get messy. Use descriptive variable names to avoid confusion.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


21. ### Optimize loops
    Optimize loops by storing the length attribute of an array in a variable to avoid recalculating it on every iteration. Keep computation-heavy code outside of loops to improve performance.
  
    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


22. ### Keep DOM access to a minimum
    Reduce DOM access since it is costly and can slow down the performance of your code. Use a tool function to transform a string to DOM elements to improve the code's speed.

        // Bad code - accessing DOM multiple times
        const element1 = document.createElement('div')
        element1.id = "myElement1"
        element1.textContent = "Hello, world!"
        element1.style.color = 'red'

        const element2 = document.createElement('div')
        element2.id = "myElement2"
        element2.textContent = "Hello, world!"
        element2.style.color = 'blue'


        // Good code - accessing DOM once using a tool function
        function createElementsFromString(str) {
        const div = document.createElement('div');
        div.innerHTML = str.trim();
        return div.firstChild;
        }

        const element1 = createElementsFromString('<div id="myElement1">Hello, world!</div>');
        element1.style.color = 'red';

        const element2 = createElementsFromString('<div id="myElement2">Hello, world!</div>');
        element2.style.color = 'blue';

23. ### Don’t write code specific to a certain browser
    Avoid over-dependence on any specific browser or its features while building your code, and use standards-based code. Otherwise, your code would become obsolete when the browser updates or a new browser is introduced.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


24. ### Validate data
    Avoid relying on invalid data, validate it before using it to avoid glitches and security threats. Do not solely depend on client-side validation, as it can create security vulnerabilities. Relying solely on client-side validation can introduce security vulnerabilities in the application. This is because client-side validation can be bypassed or manipulated by malicious users, since the validation code is running on the user's machine and is therefore under their control.
    
    For example, an attacker can simply disable or modify the client-side validation code using browser developer tools. They can also send unauthorized requests to the server, bypassing the client-side validation altogether. In either case, the server assumes the data passed through client-side validation and processes it with the assumption that it is valid. This can lead to the introduction of vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, path traversals, and other security issues.

    Therefore, it is important to implement server-side validation in addition to client-side validation to ensure a more secure application.

25. ### Avoid Overloading HTML and Use Templates Instead
    Use an HTML template and load it via Ajax instead of manipulating a document with innerHTML, which can cause flakiness, especially with certain browsers. This is because loading HTML via Ajax and manipulating the DOM directly with innerHTML can cause issues with performance, security, and browser compatibility.
    Use HTML templates and load them via Ajax. This involves separating the HTML markup from the JavaScript code, so you can manipulate the data and content without affecting the structure of the document.

    Templates can be created using various JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as Handlebars, Mustache, and React. These libraries allow you to write HTML-like syntax that can be rendered to the DOM at runtime. 

        // Define a template using Handlebars syntax
        var template = Handlebars.compile("<h1>{{title}}</h1><p>{{content}}</p>");

        // Define some data to be inserted into the template
        var data = { title: "Hello World", content: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet." };

        // Render the template to a DOM element
        var rendered = template(data);
        document.getElementById("my-div").innerHTML = rendered;

    Additionally, we should avoid the pitfalls of using innerHTML, which may lead to security vulnerabilities, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and other issues.

26. ### Carefully decide to make use of JS libraries or work with raw JS
    The decision to use JavaScript libraries or raw JavaScript depends on the project requirements and your team's expertise.

    JS libraries are prewritten codes that are developed to handle a specific task, like DOM manipulation, AJAX requests, CSS animations, etc. This allows developers to focus on building the core functionality of their applications rather than worrying about low-level implementation details. They can significantly reduce development time, eliminate the need for duplicate coding effort, and provide better code consistency and quality.

    On the other hand, using raw JavaScript can optimize page load times and improve performance by avoiding the external library files. Raw JavaScript also offers greater control, flexibility, and customization options than what a library can provide.

    In conclusion, both libraries and raw JavaScript have their advantages and disadvantages. Evaluate project requirements, performance, load times, team expertise, and desired outcomes to make a decision that fits best for your project.

27. ### Build the code developer friendly
    Do not optimize code for machines and focus on making it easy to understand for other developers. Use the build script to optimize the code for machine use.

28. ### Don't Use Shorthand
    Avoid using shorthand, which can be confusing, especially in edge cases. Use curly braces and semi-colons, so the logic and functionality are clear to other developers.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


29. ### Place Scripts at the Bottom of Your Page
    To reduce page loading time, place scripts at the bottom, especially those that add functionality after the user clicks a button.

30. ### Declare Variables and Functions Outside of the Loops
    These variables and functions will be created multiple times which will hurt the performance of your code. Move such variables and functions outside the loop instead.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


31. ### Use native methods to Build a String
    Use native methods like join() instead of a for statement when looping through arrays to make your code faster.
    In addition to the join() method, there are many other native methods available in the String prototype that can be used to manipulate strings. Some examples include slice(), substring(), toLowerCase(), and toUpperCase(). Choosing to use these native methods over writing custom string manipulation methods can lead to faster and more maintainable code.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


32. ### Use Template Literals
    Use template literals instead of traditional strings since they are more flexible and easier to work with.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


33. ### Don't Pass a String to setInterval or setTimeOut
    Instead, pass a function name to avoid inefficient code and reduce the chances of errors. 

    When we pass a string, it gets evaluated in a global scope and it is difficult to debug code. It also creates a slight overhead as the string has to be evaluated within the global scope, which can impact the performance of your application. 

    On the other hand, when we pass a function name, it directly invokes the function, and there is no overhead of string evaluation. This makes the code more efficient and less prone to errors.

    ```javascript
    // Not Recommended Way (String Method)
    setTimeout('alert("Hello World!")', 500);

    // Recommended Way (Function Method)
    setTimeout(() => {
        alert("Hello World!");
    }, 500);
    ```

    In this example, we are using the `setTimeout` method to display an alert message after 500 milliseconds. In the first example, we pass a string as a parameter to the `setTimeout` method, which will execute the code `"alert('Hello World!')"` after 500 milliseconds. This is not recommended because the string has to be evaluated in a global scope and it can be error-prone.

    In the second example, we pass an anonymous function as a parameter to the `setTimeout` method. This is the recommended way because it directly invokes the function, and there is no overhead of string evaluation. Additionally, the use of an anonymous function allows for more flexibility and provides a cleaner and more readable code.

34. ### Use object literals and arrays instead of constructors 
    Object literals and arrays are a more straightforward way to create objects and arrays in JavaScript than using the new constructor method.
    Use {} Instead of new Object() and use [] Instead of new Array() as when using the new constructor method in JavaScript, there are a few potential pitfalls to be aware of.

    One common issue is with accidental type coercion. When using new with a non-primitive value (like an object or array), the new keyword can cause unexpected type coercion. For example, if you accidentally omit the new keyword when creating a new instance of an object using a constructor function, the this keyword inside the constructor will refer to the global object instead of the new object you intended to create, which can lead to unintended consequences in your code.

    Additionally, the new keyword can add a bit of extra complexity and confusion when creating objects or arrays. By using object literals ({}) or array literals ([]) instead of the new constructor notation, you can simplify your code and make it easier to understand.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


35. ### Use SetTimeout instead of SetInterval
    Use the SetTimeout function instead of SetInterval to prevent performance issues. It's generally better to use setTimeout when the processing time of each iteration of the task cannot be predicted or when there is asynchronous code involved.

    Using setInterval
    function makeApiRequest() {
        fetch('https://example.api.com/data')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => {
            // Process data here
            console.log(data);
            })
            .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
            });
        }

        setInterval(makeApiRequest, 5000);

    Using setTimeout
    function makeApiRequest() {
        fetch('https://example.api.com/data')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => {
            // Process data here
            console.log(data);
            })
            .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
            })
            .finally(() => {
            // Make the next request after 5 seconds
            setTimeout(makeApiRequest, 5000);
            });
        }

        makeApiRequest();

36. ### Use the Spread Operator
    Use the spread operator (...) to insert all values from one array into another or pass all items of an array as individual elements to another function. It can also be used for copying objects and arrays, rather than using Object.assign or slice methods.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


37. ### Be Careful With for ... in Statements
    When using a for...in loop to loop through an object, filter out method functions (such as hasOwnProperty) and other inherited properties by wrapping the code in an if statement.

    ```
    const obj = {
        a: 1,
        b: 2,
        c: 3,
        hasOwnProperty: function() {
            // This is a method function
        },
        toString: Object.prototype.toString
        };

    for (let key in obj) {
        if (typeof obj[key] !== "function" && key !== "hasOwnProperty" && key !== "toString") {
            console.log(key, obj[key]);
        }
    }
    ```

    Filtering out method functions and other inherited properties can make your code more readable and maintainable.

38. ### Use Self-Executing Functions
    Make use of self-executing functions to run a function automatically when a page loads or a parent function is called. This approach can be beneficial as it ensures that the code runs immediately, without having to be called elsewhere in the code.

    Using self-executing functions can also help avoid conflicts with other scripts, global variables and namespace issues, particularly when dealing with libraries or code that contains lots of functions.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


39. ### Use Event Emitters instead of Callbacks
    While using callbacks work perfectly fine in a small codebase, it can lead to callback hell, which becomes difficult to maintain and debug as the codebase grows. Using event emitters will improve code maintainability, readability, and prevent callback hell.

    Using Event Emiitter
    
        const EventEmitter = require('events');
        const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

        const processReport = (report) => {
        console.log(`Report processed: ${report}`);
        };

        // Registering the event with a callback function
        eventEmitter.on('processReport', processReport);

        const reportGenerator = () => {
        // Generate report
        const report = 'Some report';

        // Emitting the event with report as the parameter
        eventEmitter.emit('processReport', report);
        }

        // Generating the report
        reportGenerator();
 
    Using Callbacks
    
        const processReport = (report, callback) => {
        // Do some processing
        console.log(`Report processed: ${report}`);
        // Call the callback function once processing is done
        return callback();
        }

        const reportGenerator = (callback) => {
        // Generate report
        const report = 'Some report';
        // Process the report with a callback
        processReport(report, callback);
        }

        // Generating the report with a callback
        reportGenerator(() => {
        console.log('Report generation complete.');
        });

40. ### Quickly Assign Variable Values With Destructuring
    Use destructuring to extract values from objects and arrays easily. This allows us to avoid variable assignments for values we don't need. Also, destructuring assignment can be used for function arguments to make them more inline for readability.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


41. ### Make use of Iterators and for ... of Loops
    Iterators in JavaScript are objects which implement the next() method to return an object that stores the next value in a sequence and true or false depending on whether or not there are any more values left. JavaScript also has some built-in iterators like String, Array, Map, etc. You can iterate over them using for ... of loops. 
    
    Use iterators and for...of loops for more concise and less error-prone code.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


42. ### Use async and await
    Promises can be used for Asynchronous Code to avoid callback hell. Asynchronous functions can be created with the async keyword and take advantage of the await keyword to stop execution until the resolution of returned promises. Use async and await keywords for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


43. ### Use Arrow Functions more
    Use arrow functions for more readable and concise functional JavaScript code.

    Another notable benefit of arrow functions is that they do not define a scope, instead being within the parent scope. This prevents many of the issues that can occur when using the this keyword. There are no bindings for this in the arrow functions. 'this' has the same value inside the arrow function as it does in the parent scope. However, this means arrow functions can't be used as constructors or methods.

56. ### Use the Proxy Object to Intercept Object Operations 
    Use the Proxy object to intercept object operations and customize their behavior. This can be useful for adding validation or access control to objects.

    const user = {
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Doe',
        password: 'secret'
        };

        const userProxy = new Proxy(user, {
        get(target, property) {
            if (property === 'password') {
            throw new Error('Access denied');
            } else {
            return target[property];
            }
        },
        set(target, property, value) {
            if (property === 'firstName') {
            throw new Error('Cannot modify first name');
            } else {
            target[property] = value;
            }
        }
        });

        console.log(userProxy.firstName); // "John"
        console.log(userProxy.lastName); // "Doe"
        console.log(userProxy.password); // Throws "Access denied" error
        userProxy.firstName = 'Jane'; // Throws "Cannot modify first name" error
        userProxy.age = 25; // Adds the "age" property to the user object
        console.log(userProxy.age); // 25
