1. ### Avoid Global Variables

    Minimize the use of global variables.

    This includes all data types, objects, and functions.

    Global variables and functions can be overwritten by other scripts.

    Use local variables instead, and learn how to use closures.

2. ### Always Declare Local Variables

    All variables used in a function should be declared as local variables.
    
    Local variables must be declared with the var, the let, or the const keyword, otherwise they will become global variables.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
      
3. ### Declarations on Top

    It is a good coding practice to put all declarations at the top of each script or function.

    This will:

    - Give cleaner code
    - Provide a single place to look for local variables
    - Make it easier to avoid unwanted (implied) global variables
    - Reduce the possibility of unwanted re-declarations

4. ### Initialize Variables

     It is a good coding practice to initialize variables when you declare them.

     This will:

      - Give cleaner code
      - Provide a single place to initialize variables
      - Avoid undefined values

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

5. ### Declare Objects with const
      Declaring objects with const will prevent any accidental change.

6. ### Declare Arrays with const
    Declaring arrays with const will prevent any accidential change.

7. ### Don't Use new Object
    - Use "" instead of new String()
    - Use 0 instead of new Number()
    - Use false instead of new Boolean()
    - Use {} instead of new Object()
    - Use [] instead of new Array()
    - Use /()/ instead of new RegExp()
    - Use function (){} instead of new Function()

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
      
8. ### Beware of Automatic Type Conversions
    - JavaScript is loosely typed.

    - A variable can contain all data types.

    - A variable can change its data type:

9. ### Use === Comparison
    The == comparison operator always converts (to matching types) before comparison.

    The === operator forces comparison of values and type:

10. ### Use Parameter Defaults
    If a function is called with a missing argument, the value of the missing argument is set to undefined.

    Undefined values can break your code. It is a good habit to assign default values to arguments.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
      
11. ### End Your Switches with Defaults
    Always end your switch statements with a default. Even if you think there is no need for it.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
      
12. ### Avoid Number, String, and Boolean as Objects
    Always treat numbers, strings, or booleans as primitive values. Not as objects.

    Declaring these types as objects, slows down execution speed, and produces nasty side effects:
